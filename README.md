# **I'm Cipher Visor**

### **Another new programmer trying learn the trade. I figure if I can teach something well then I will have learned it well myself, hence my train of thought here. I'm also looking into networking and more interestingly cyber security.**

#### **Languages and shells I'm familiar with**
* C++ (as well as on the Arduino platform)
* Python
* Unix sh/sh derivatives
* MS Batch, Powershell
* HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript (not the best)
* Learning more about SQL
